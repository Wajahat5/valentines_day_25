                    Even though miles separate us, my love for you knows no
                    distance. Every day, I carry you in my thoughts, my heart,
                    and my dreams. You are my constant reminder that love
                    transcends time and space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This little gift is a reminder that no matter how far apart
                    we are, youâ€™re my favorite person in the world. I canâ€™t wait
                    to close the distance and make up for all the hugs, laughs,
                    and adventures weâ€™ve missed.
